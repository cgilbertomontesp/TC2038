Test Cases for the Merge Sort Algorithm

## 1. Sorted Array
An array that is already sorted.
Example Input:
5
1.0
2.0
3.0
4.0
5.0

## 2. Array with decimal numbers
An array that contains decimal numbers.
Example Input:
5
1.5
1.3
1.9
2.0
1.1

## 3. Array with All Identical Elements
An array where all elements are identical.
Example Input:
4
7.0
7.0
7.0
7.0

## 4. Array with an Odd Number of Elements
An array that contains an odd number of elements and is not sorted.
Example Input:
5
9.0
3.0
5.0
1.0
7.0

MergeSort has a constant case worst, average and best time complexity of O(n log n)
